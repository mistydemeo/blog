  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people got their first taste of widescreen gaming with the Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3, but not a lot of people know that companies were experimenting with widescreen all the way back in the fifth console generation (PS1, Saturn, N64). A tiny number of games have full widescreen support, which looks great on modern widescreen TVs.</p>

<h2>Anamorphic widescreen</h2>

<p>(Skip to the next section if you just care about pretty pictures!)</p>

<p>Since there isn&rsquo;t a widescreen resolution in the SDTV standards, all widescreen games used a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphic_widescreen">anamorphic widescreen</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In anamorphic widescreen, the game squeezes down a 16:9 scene into 4:3; the TV then stretches the 4:3 image back out to 16:9 for display. For example, take a look at this image from Christmas Nights:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Nights_3_wide_unscaled.png"></p>

<p>You can see that the proportions on everything are too thin&mdash;it&rsquo;s very noticeable on Claris. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like stretched out:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Nights_2_wide.png"></p>

<p>This shows you a lot more of the game world than you&rsquo;d get in the standard 4:3 mode, but you can see that all of the 2D elements in the scene are displayed with the wrong aspect ratio. This lack of aspect ratio correction for 2D elements is common to most widescreen games of that era. In Nights, for example, you can see that the interface elements and all 2D in-game elements (the tree, the stars in the upper left corner) are displayed at the wrong aspect ratio when playing in widescreen. This hurts some games more than others.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Christmas Nights</h3>

<p>Both Christmas Nights and Nights support native widescreen. This is probably one of the most famous widescreen games of the era.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Nights_1_narrow.png"></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Nights_2_wide.png"></p>

<p>Nights benefits enormously from a wider field of view, even though it uses a lot of sprites. Being able to see more of where you&rsquo;re going makes for a much better game.</p>

<h3>Panzer Dragoon Zwei</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Panzer_1_narrow.png"></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Panzer_2_wide.png"></p>

<p>Like Nights, Panzer Zwei has a similar field of view in either mode, with more content displayed on the sides.</p>

<h3>Baroque</h3>

<p>This is an obscure game, but Baroque&rsquo;s spare, gritty low-poly nightmarish landscapes are some of the most beautiful and haunting I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It reminds me a lot of <a href="http://cicadamarionette.com/">Lilith</a>&rsquo;s dreamscapes, like <a href="http://lilithzone.itch.io/oneiric-gardens">Oneiric Gardens</a> and <a href="http://cicadamarionette.com/Games/CryptWorlds/Main.html">Crypt Worlds</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Baroque_1_narrow.png"></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Baroque_2_wide.png"></p>

<p>Baroque makes heavy use of sprites; all of the game&rsquo;s NPCs and enemies are sprites in a 3D space. Unfortunately, that makes it look worse in widescreen than the other games I&rsquo;ve written about.</p>

<h3>Virtua Fighter (32X)</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Virtua_1_narrow.png"></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/widescreen/Virtua_2_wide.png"></p>

<p>This game&rsquo;s almost entirely 3D, so it scales very well; the only major 2D element is the 2D background.</p>

<h2>More</h2>

<p>A more complete list of widescreen games of this generation is available on the <a href="http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?25942-5th-Generation-Games-List-Playing-in-Widescreen">Sega-16 forums</a>.</p>

<p>This is the same technique used by widescreen DVDs and Wii games.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>I&rsquo;ve focused on Sega games for this post; I haven&rsquo;t checked to see whether PS1 or N64 games have the same aspect ratio issues with sprites.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

      <p class="meta">
        




<time class='entry-date' datetime='2014-12-05T18:57:06-08:00'><span class='date'><span class='date-month'>Dec</span> <span class='date-day'>5</span><span class='date-suffix'>th</span>, <span class='date-year'>2014</span></span> <span class='time'>6:57 pm</span></time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Big GCC changes are a-coming to <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, which will make building your own software against Homebrew-provided GCCs much more reliable. There&rsquo;s going to be a transition period, though, and any software built against GCC will need to be rebuilt against the new package to work. We&rsquo;ll be pushing the changes on <strong>December 12th, 2014</strong>, and this post is here to help you get ready for it!</p>

<p>(This only affects software built using Homebrew&rsquo;s GCC. Any software built using Clang, which is the compiler that Apple ships, will be unaffected. If you don&rsquo;t know what this means: you&rsquo;re probably fine.)</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Since Apple provides many of the same libraries as GCC, Homebrew installs GCC to a nonstandard location in order to avoid shadowing those libraries. Homebrew currently installs GCC using the <code>--enable-version-specific-runtime-libs</code> option to sandbox its libraries and headers, which installs libraries into versioned locations like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0/4.9.2/libgfortran.3.dylib</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since the full version of GCC is embedded&mdash;including the minor version&mdash;along with the OS version, every minor release is installed to a new location; this breaks any software which has dynamically linked against a previous GCC version&rsquo;s copies of these libraries.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s changing</h2>

<p>The new GCC package we are shipping will install GCC libraries to a path containing only the series version of GCC. For example, libgfortran will now be installed to:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>/usr/local/lib/gcc/4.9/libgfortran.3.dylib</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>New releases of GCC 4.9 will be installed to the same path, so software built using GCC 4.9.2 will work with software built using GCC 4.9.3.</li>
<li>The same changes will be applied to the <code>gcc49</code> formula in the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/">homebrew/versions</a> repository, allowing <code>gcc49</code> to provide the 4.9 libraries when <code>gcc</code> is eventually upgraded to 5.0.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What you need to do</h2>

<h3>If you&rsquo;re a user</h3>

<p>If you have built any software using the Homebrew-installed GCC, you will need to reinstall that software once the package is updated on the 12th.</p>

<h3>If you provide binary packages built using the Homebrew-installed GCC</h3>

<p>If you provide binary packages that were built using the Homebrew-installed GCC, you should rebuild them using the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/34303">new formula</a> and have them ready for your users on the 12th.</p>

<h3>If you maintain Homebrew formulae that use GCC/GFortran</h3>

<p>If you maintain Homebrew formulae that build using GCC or GFortran, you should consider <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Formula-Cookbook.md#formulae-revisions">bumping their revisions</a> on the 12th to ensure that users rebuild them against the new GCC package.</p>

<h2>The tl;dr version</h2>

<p>On December 12, 2014, we will push a new GCC package that changes the install location of libraries. Any software you&rsquo;ve built using the old package (for instance, C++ or Fortran software) will no longer work and will need to be reinstalled. If you build packages for distribution using Homebrew&rsquo;s GCC package, make sure you&rsquo;ve built new versions using our new package and have them ready to distribute at that date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/bess/">Bess Sadler</a>, <a href="http://andromedayelton.com/">Andromeda Yelton</a>, <a href="http://chrisbourg.wordpress.com/">Chris Bourg</a> and <a href="http://matienzo.org/">Mark Matienzo</a> have stepped forward to pledge to <a href="https://adainitiative.org/donate/?campaign=libraries">match up to $5120 of donations</a> to the <a href="http://adainitiative.org/">Ada Initiative</a>, a non-profit organization that supports the participation of women in open source and culture. I completely support this very generous act; the Ada Initiative does <a href="http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/">incredibly important</a> work, and I&rsquo;m extremely proud of my friends and of the library community for supporting them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/there-and-back-again">written before</a> about how I stopped pursuing a career in tech in my late teens. I saw few female (or trans) role models in the tech industry; at a time when my self-image and self-identity was its most fragile, I pivoted away from something I saw as too masculine, without room for me. The Ada Initiative&rsquo;s conferences and advocacy work have done a lot to help make the open tech world a more welcoming space.</p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons why women don&rsquo;t enter, or don&rsquo;t stay, in the tech industry. The last few weeks, when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/01/how-to-attack-a-woman-who-works-in-video-games">harassment campaigns</a> have <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/gamergate-harms-women/">targeted women to drive them out of the video game industry</a>, have made me reflect on how important it is to work to make online communities and conferences safe spaces.</p>

<p>The Ada Initiative&rsquo;s <a href="http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/">conference policy advocacy work</a> and their <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment">example anti-harassment policy</a> have been instrumental in helping many organizations and projects adopt their own policies. Both the <a href="https://github.com/code4lib/antiharassment-policy">Code4lib anti-harassment policy</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md">Homebrew code of conduct</a>, for example, were inspired by and partially based on the Ada Initiative&rsquo;s work. Seeing organizations adopt these policies has done a lot to make me feel comfortable, and given me confidence that both preventing and dealing with these forms of harassment is something that they see as important. My hope is that future generations of women will feel comfortable entering and interacting in these spaces in ways that others may not have in the past.</p>

<p>In just a few years, the Ada Initiative has helped make sure that these policies are becoming the norm and not the exception for conferences and online communities. I&rsquo;m so grateful we have their advocacy; please consider <a href="https://supportada.org/?campaign=libraries">donating</a> to help them do even more great things.</p>
